# The BIDS Toolbox

This repository holds the code for The BIDS Toolbox, a web service for the creation and manipulation of BIDS datasets. It has been developed at the Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre (CUBRIC) in collaboration with Cardiff University Data Innovation Research Institute (DIRI).

Currently, this project is a prototype under development and not every feature has been fully tested. It uses parts of the open source [bidskit](https://github.com/jmtyszka/bidskit) tool for the creation of BIDS datasets.

Please, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/ulopeznovoa/bids-toolbox/wiki) of this repository for information about installation and usage. 

More information about The BIDS Toolbox can be found in this paper: [The BIDS Toolbox: A web Service to Manage Brain Imaging Datasets](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9060259) of the [Workshop on Data Preprocessing for Big Biomedical Data 2019](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/informatics/people/yudong-zhang/workshop/dpbbd).

This work was done as part of the *Microstructural Imaging Data Centre (MIDaC)* project, funded by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) of the United Kingdom (grant number ST/S00209X/1).
